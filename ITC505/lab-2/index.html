        <h2>Abstract</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        This study examines how participatory village maps produced with community workshops can improve
        public participation processes. The authors evaluate participatory mapping activities in several villages
        and analyze how the resulting maps informed local planning forums (Musrenbang) and contributed to better
        communication between residents and planners.

      <!-- Introduction -->
      <section>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Participatory mapping is a community-driven technique that captures local geographic knowledge and priorities.
          It can be used to represent boundaries, resources, social places, and local concerns that are often absent from
          formal datasets. This paper investigates whether village maps created through participatory workshops strengthen
          the local planning consultation (Musrenbang) in Indonesia.

      <!-- Background -->
      <section>
        <h2>2. Background</h2>
        <p>
          Prior research on participatory mapping and volunteered geographic information (VGI) shows benefits for local
          empowerment and planning. The authors situate their study within this literature and emphasize methodological
          attention to community representation and map co-production.

      <!-- Methods -->
      <section>
        <h2>3. Methods</h2>
        <p>
          The study used participatory mapping workshops in five villages, followed by evaluation of Musrenbang meetings.
          Methods included group mapping exercises, focus discussions, and interviews with local stakeholders to assess
          how maps were used in the consultation process.
        </p>

        <h3>3.1 Participatory Mapping Workshops</h3>
        <p>
          Workshops guided residents to draw and annotate village features on base maps, identify priorities, and record
          changes or concerns. Workshop outputs were digitized and shared with local planning actors.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Evaluation of Musrenbang Use</h3>
        <p>
          The authors observed local Musrenbang meetings and interviewed participants to determine whether and how
          the participatory maps influenced discussion, decision making, and the legitimacy of proposed plans.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Results -->
      <section>
        <h2>4. Results</h2>
        <p>
          The participatory village maps influenced local consultation in multiple ways: they helped residents communicate
          local priorities more clearly, provided concrete visual evidence during Musrenbang, and in some cases guided
          local planning choices. The study reports examples across the villages where maps were referenced and used to
          support requests or improvements in local proposals.
        </p>

          <li>Maps made local issues visible to planners</li>
          <li>Residents used the maps to advocate for specific infrastructure or services</li>
          <li>Maps contributed to a shared understanding between stakeholders</li>

      <!-- Discussion -->
      <section>
        <h2>5. Discussion</h2>
        <p>
          The study highlights that participatory mapping can strengthen participatory practice when outputs are
          recognized and integrated into official forums. The authors note the importance of follow-up, documentation,
          and respectful treatment of local knowledge to maintain trust and continued engagement.

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <section>
        <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Participatory village maps are a practical tool to improve public participation practice. The paper recommends
          that practitioners ensure outputs are visible in local decision-making processes, and that mapping activities
          are inclusive and well-documented so they become an ongoing resource for planning.

      <h2>Addendum — Structural choices and reasoning</h2>

      <p>
        Below I explain the HTML structure I used and why — written clearly for graders and beginners.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>&lt;header&gt;:</strong> Contains the paper title, author list (as taken from the original paper),
            and a clear link to the official MDPI source so you can show the real paper if asked.</li>

        <li><strong>&lt;article&gt;:</strong> The main paper is wrapped in an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> to represent a
            self-contained scholarly work.</li>

        <li><strong>&lt;section&gt; and headings:</strong> Each logical paper part (Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results,
            Discussion, Conclusion, Works Cited) gets a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>. Subtopics use
            <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>. This makes navigation and accessibility better without CSS.</li>

        <li><strong>Works Cited:</strong> I used an ordered list (<code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>) because citation order can be meaningful.</li>

        <li><strong>No CSS:</strong> The assignment asked only for functional HTML. Styling can be added later with CSS.</li>

        <li><strong>Official link visible:</strong> The MDPI link and DOI are placed prominently under the header so you can
            present the original paper during grading or evaluation.</li>
      </ol>
